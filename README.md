Outliner generates a table of contents by extracting all the headings in the page.

Many pages on the Internet do not feature a well-designed in-page navigator. Outliner is here to help.


How to use
----

1. Click the Outliner button beside your address bar to activate it. You will see a box coming from left with the outline in it.
2. Click on any of the headings in the outline to jump to the corresponding section on the page.
3. Click the cross button on the bottom left to close the outline.
